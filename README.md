# Book Review Block #

Book Review Block enables you to add details such as title, author, cover image, star rating and more to all of your book reviews.

## Save Time ##
Book Review Block saves you valuable time when writing your reviews. No more copy and paste or manually entering the details of a book. Instead, you provide the ISBN, and the block automatically fills in information like title, author, and even the cover image.

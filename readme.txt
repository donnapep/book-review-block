A block to add book details and a star rating to a book review.

== Description ==

Book Review Block enables you to add details such as title, author, cover image, star rating and more to all of your book reviews.

= Save Time =
Book Review Block saves you valuable time when writing your reviews. No more copy and paste or manually entering the details of a book. Instead, you provide the ISBN, and the block automatically fills in information like title, author, and even the cover image.

= Increase Traffic =
Book Review Block adds Schema markup to the HTML. This can help increase site traffic by ensuring your Google search results stand out from the rest.
